# Introduction

Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the most predominant cause of death in women worldwide. 
Imaging techniques such as the breast cancer pathology helps in the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. 
However identification of malignant cells can be challenging given the high heterogeneity in tissue absorbotion from 
staining agents. In this work, we present a novel approach for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) cells discrimination in 
histopathology slides.

We used an open IDC dataset that can be found here:

The following figure shows some samples from the used Open IDC Dataset.  
Left: three IDC cell patches; Right: three normal tissue patches.

We propose a model derived from the Inception architecture, proposing a multi-level batch normalization module between 
each convolutional steps. This module was used as a base block for the feature extraction in a CNN architecture. 
We used the open IDC dataset in which we obtained a balanced accuracy of 0.89 and an F1 score of 0.90, thus surpassing
recent state of the art classification algorithms tested on this public dataset

The following figure shows the used Inception modeules that incorporates Batch normalization.

methods.

## Reproducibility
  
### Download this git repository and run local
The firts step is to clone this repository
 
~~~
git clone https://github.com/fperdigon/DeepHistoPathology
~~~

The next step is to create the Conda environment using the provided environment.yml file. For this step you need the 
conda python package manage installed. In case you don't have it installed we recommend installing 
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) to avoid installing unnecessary Python 
packages. 

To create the conda environment run the following command:
~~~
conda env create -f environment.yaml
~~~

Then activate the Python environment you just created with the following command:

~~~
conda activate DeepHP
~~~

Finally start the training and the experiments by running the command:

~~~
python DeepHP_main.py
~~~

This python script will:
- Download the data to the data folder
- Extract the Data zip in the data folder
- Train the model 
- Calculate performance metrics and display them in the console
- Generate confusion Matrix and ROC curve figures

If you have a Nvidia CUDA capable device for GPU acceleration this code will automatically use it (faster). Otherwise the 
training will be done in CPU (slower).
